```

Capacitor packages the compiled frontend inside the APK. The app communicates with the deployed HTTPS backend at runtime; it does not load the application UI from a remote website.

## Services

The Android app uses the repository’s deployed Next.js service for operations that must remain server-side, including:

- Authenticated event and participant operations
- Perfect Corp virtual try-on and skin-tone requests
- Qwen group-preview generation
- Supabase service-role operations
- RevenueCat entitlement verification and webhook handling
- Android App Link association and browser fallback invitations

Supabase provides authentication, database storage, image storage and realtime updates. Private provider keys remain on the deployed backend. Only public mobile configuration is bundled into the APK.

## RevenueCat subscription access

The app offers a one-time **Vows & Vibe Pro Wedding Pass**. RevenueCat identifies the signed-in bride by her Supabase user ID, while the backend verifies access before paid operations. Invited bridesmaids inherit the bride’s verified wedding access and do not purchase separately.

The current APK uses RevenueCat’s Test Store, allowing the purchase flow to run without a Play Store release or real charge. RevenueCat webhooks update the server-side entitlement snapshot, and the app refreshes access directly after a completed purchase.

## Build the APK

Requirements:

- Node.js 22 or newer
- Java 21
- Android SDK Platform 36 and Android build tools
- Public mobile configuration in `mobile/.env.local`

From this directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run android:build
```

The APK is generated at:

```text
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Every `VITE_*` variable is compiled into the APK and must therefore contain public values only. Supabase service-role keys, provider secrets, RevenueCat secret keys and webhook authorization values belong exclusively in the deployed backend environment.
