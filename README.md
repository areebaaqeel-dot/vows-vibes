# Vows & Vibe

**See it. Style it. Love it.**

Vows & Vibe is an Android bridal-party styling application. A bride creates a wedding, defines its style and palette, invites bridesmaids, and brings everyone’s confirmed virtual try-on into a shared lineup.

The Android application is located in [`mobile/`](mobile/). Server-side APIs, authentication callbacks and invitation services are maintained at the repository root and deployed on Vercel.

## Bride workflow

The bride signs in with Google and can:

1. Create and manage one wedding event.
2. Set the date, dress direction, fabric, length and color palette.
3. Add example dresses and share the private invitation link.
4. Upload a full-body photo and capture one guided skin-tone selfie.
5. Generate and save virtual try-on previews.
6. Confirm her final look.
7. Arrange confirmed party members in the lineup canvas.
8. Filter the lineup by palette relationship.
9. Open a bridesmaid list and enter an individual suggestion conversation.
10. Generate a venue group preview or export the arranged lineup.

The bride can also delete the event and its associated participant photos, dresses, previews, messages and lineup data.

## Bridesmaid workflow

A bridesmaid opens the wedding invitation, enters her name and receives a private fitting session. She can:

1. Review the bride’s event summary and palette.
2. Upload a full-body photo.
3. Capture a guided selfie for her personal color guide.
4. Choose an example dress or upload her own dress.
5. Generate virtual try-ons and revisit saved previews.
6. Confirm one look for the shared lineup.
7. View the lineup and the bride’s saved group preview.
8. Exchange suggestions directly with the bride.

Bridesmaids cannot message other bridesmaids. The bride has a separate conversation for each bridesmaid, while a bridesmaid opens directly into her conversation with the bride.

## Color guidance

The app keeps color guidance simple and advisory:

- A guided selfie produces a saved skin-tone value and warm, cool or neutral undertone classification.
- The color guide shows shades that generally complement that undertone and shades that may appear less balanced.
- The event summary can place an undertone-aware **Suggested match** beside suitable colors from the bride’s palette.
- Bridesmaid dress cards can show **Family Match** when a shade coordinates closely with the wedding palette.
- Bridesmaid dress cards can show **Related shade** when a color belongs to the same family but is noticeably lighter, darker or different.
- No badge is shown when a bridesmaid dress is neither a Family Match nor a Related shade.
- The bride’s lineup canvas retains Palette Match, Family Match, Related shade and Different family filtering.

skin tone classification use CIE Lab conversion and Palette relationships uses CIEDE2000 distance where perceptual comparison is useful. Results are styling suggestions rather than scientific or mandatory rules; lighting, cameras, fabric and personal preference still matter.

## Virtual try-on and privacy

The full-body photo is uploaded to the wedding’s private fitting workflow and is removed when the event is deleted. The separate guided selfie is sent to Perfect Corp for analysis in memory and is not saved to Supabase Storage. Only the derived skin, hair and undertone values are retained.

Virtual try-on attempts are stored in `vto_attempts`, allowing each participant to revisit previous successful previews and confirm one final look. Confirmed looks receive background-removed cutouts for the shared lineup.

## Suggestions

Suggestions use the Supabase message and Realtime:

- Bride → bridesmaid is allowed.
- Bridesmaid → bride is allowed.
- Messages are organized into individual conversations.
- Suggestions remain tied to the recipient’s current confirmed look, so stale look-specific messages are not shown after that look changes.

## RevenueCat Wedding Pass

The Android app uses RevenueCat for a one-time **Vows & Vibe Pro Wedding Pass**.

### Access model

- The bride purchases the pass once for her wedding.
- RevenueCat customer identity uses the signed-in bride’s Supabase user UUID.
- The active entitlement ID is `vows_vibes_pro`.
- Invited bridesmaids inherit the bride’s verified entitlement and never purchase separately.
- The free bride plan supports one wedding, two dress uploads, two successful bride try-ons and one saved bride skin-tone analysis.
- Pro supports eight total successful try-ons per participant, one saved skin-tone analysis per participant, unlimited dress uploads, suggestions, lineup saving/export and group previews.
- Try-on allowances are totals for the wedding and do not reset.


## Shared lineup and group preview

Confirmed participant cutouts appear in a Fabric.js canvas controlled by the bride. The bride can reposition people, adjust layering, hide participants, filter by palette relationship, save the arrangement and export a PNG.

For a polished group preview, the bride can add a venue image and generate a composition through Alibaba Cloud Model Studio’s Qwen Image API. A saved preview becomes visible to the bridal party.

## Mobile architecture and supporting services

- **Android app:** Capacitor 8 with a bundled Vite/React frontend
- **Supporting backend:** Next.js 16 API routes, authentication callbacks and invitation endpoints deployed on Vercel
- **Auth, database, storage and realtime:** Supabase
- **Purchases and entitlements:** RevenueCat Capacitor SDK plus server-side verification and webhooks
- **Virtual try-on and skin analysis:** Perfect Corp YouCam APIs
- **Lineup canvas:** Fabric.js
- **Background removal:** `@imgly/background-removal-node`
- **Group preview:** Alibaba Cloud Model Studio / Qwen Image

The Android package ID is `com.vowsvibe.mobile`. The APK bundles its frontend assets and communicates with the deployed HTTPS backend; it does not require a locally running Next.js server.

## Build the Android APK

### Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer
- Java 21
- Android SDK Platform 36 and build tools
- A configured `mobile/.env.local` containing public mobile values only

Install the mobile dependencies:

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
```

Create `mobile/.env.local` from `mobile/.env.example` and configure the deployed services:

```dotenv
VITE_APP_MODE=live
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://vowsvibe-one.vercel.app
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY
VITE_INVITE_BASE_URL=https://vowsvibe-one.vercel.app
VITE_CAMERA_KIT_ENABLED=false
VITE_REVENUECAT_API_KEY=YOUR_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_TEST_STORE_KEY
VITE_REVENUECAT_ENTITLEMENT=vows_vibes_pro
VITE_REVENUECAT_OFFERING=
```

Never place a Supabase service-role key, RevenueCat secret key or webhook authorization value in `mobile/.env.local`; every `VITE_*` value is bundled into the APK.

Build the debug APK:

```bash
npm run android:build
```

The generated file is:

```text
mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Install or update it on a connected Android device without clearing app data:

```bash
$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The debug APK is intended for direct device installation. A store release requires a production RevenueCat Android public key and a separately configured release-signing setup.
